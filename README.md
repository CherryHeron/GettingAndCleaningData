# GettingAndCleaningData
THIS IS A COUSERA PROJECT OF THE COURSE "GETTING AND CLEANING DATA"

## Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this [article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/).
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.

In this project, data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone was retrieved, worked with, and cleaned, to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later 

## The purpose of this project 
to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

## The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The data used in this project is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## The outcome includes
* an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

* a README.md 

## This repository includes:

* README.md, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
* tidydata.txt, which contains the data set.
* CodeBook.md, the code book, which describes the contents of the data set (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data).
* run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set.
